# Therapist Matching API Server

This repository contains a **Python-based API server** implemented in a **Deepnote notebook**.  
The server exposes a **deterministic therapist–patient matching logic** via a REST interface and is designed to integrate with **Camunda BPMN/DMN workflows** or other external clients.

The focus of this project is on **explainable, rule-based decision-making**, not machine learning inference.

---

## Overview

The API server acts as a **decision service** that:

- Accepts structured patient preference data
- Normalizes and encodes inputs into canonical decision variables
- Computes availability and compatibility scores
- Returns a deterministic therapist match

The implementation prioritizes **clarity, auditability, and extensibility**.
