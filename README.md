# Therapist Matcher/Find My Therapy? todo

**Automation of Patient-Therapist Matching.** This tool digitalizes and simplifies the process for patients seeking a fitting and available therapist after receiving a prescription. By matching patients against professional criteria, capacity, and individual patient needs, it ensures a more efficient search for the patient and provides therapists with a clear digital interface to efficiently accept or decline new patients.

# Recap of the integrated Flow

1. Person wants to find a matching therapist
2. Based on preference, Person can either call a service-number OR fill out a form with given dimensions to look for a psychotherapist
3. Variables from the form are transmitted to a decision table
  -takes variables and transforms them into integer categories
  -per single variable a integer is transmitted to the final decision table
  -decision table consists of implemented patient therapeutic-logic
4. Single variable "therapists_id" with matching Therapists-Name ist generated
5. Matching-Result is transferred via API to the requesting person
6. Person transfers response back (API)
7. Psychotherapist is informed about the possible appointment
8.

**Current Limitations**

Currently, Buddy may face challenges with highly specific inquiries, such as incorrect order numbers, leading to response loops. As Buddy is still a test model and not yet live, this is acceptable within the project’s scope. 
To mitigate the risk of misinformation, Buddy is designed with restricted pathways, ensuring that only valid paths are triggered and preventing inaccurate responses. Loosening those restrictions and adding more scenarios will make the chatbot easily scalable to cover additional services (e.g. delivery updates, FAQs and more) in the future.

Future updates will focus on refining phrasing and expanding language capabilities. At the moment the chatbot operates in English only when workflows are triggered.

# Process Improvements
In our analysis of the original order-to-shipment process, we identified several key challenges: fragmented communication, manual data handling, inefficient follow-ups, and a lack of automation. These issues led to delays, errors, and inconsistent customer experiences. To address these pain points, we designed and implemented a digitalized and automated solution. Our improved process reduces manual workload, increases transparency, and speeds up response times, all while maintaining flexibility and human oversight where necessary.

| Manual PO checks        |Google Forms + automated trigger |



# 🔮 Future Steps and Opportunities
While the current process delivers major improvements in automation, communication, and efficiency, there are several areas where further enhancements can provide even greater value and scalability.

**Process Enhancements**
- Optimize


**Operational Efficiency and Costs**

- Time-Savings Potential:
- Integration with possible therapist-IT-infrastructure:
